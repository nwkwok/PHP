# How & why to use Facades & Service Providers in Laravel

### Service Container
At the core of Laravel is a component called the Service Container which you can imagine as being like the contacts list on your phone. You look up a name in your contacts and see their corresponding number. Similarly, in Laravel, you can lookup components of the framework, for example, cache, and the service container will give you the Cache component. Easy!

### Service Providers
Like adding a new friend to your contacts so you can access their phone number whenever you need, we can add new service providers to Laravel to let us access them in our applications in a number of ways.

### Facades
Another way to access the service container is with Facades. These are again similar to the contacts in your phone analogy, but this time imagine assigning a nickname to each contact that you can easily remember.
