Interfaces
	
	Commonly used for dependency inversion 
	
	Signature — 
		Definition of a method including its parameters and its return value
        
	There can be multiple implementations of the same interface
	Exists so that multiple things can be implemented

	Implement — 
		do the thing that you say you’re going to do
		Here’s the plan to do XYZ
		Now we’re going to implement the plan

	Interface — 
		says what the object does
		Implementation actually does it

	Hump with OOP
		Stuff becomes important as projects get bigger, more complex and make them modular
		
	OOP is a way to organize code 
		Doesn’t unlock new types of computation — it’s a way of structuring your code

	Interface mandates that the methods that are in the interface must be implemented
